This repository contains assembly code and scripts used in the lab classes of the course "Architettura degli Elaboratori" of the Department of Computer Science of the University of Catania.

## Emulate Raspberry Pi OS on QEMU

In order to emulate Raspberry Pi OS on Ubuntu you need:

* qemu-system
* Latest qemu kernel
* Raspberry Pi OS image

### Download quemu-system using apt-get

```bash
sudo apt-get install qemu-system
```

### Get the latest qemu kernel

This [git repository](https://github.com/dhruvvyas90/qemu-rpi-kernel) contains the latest qemu-rpi kernel. I added a copy of the repository here in the folder ___qemu-rpi-kernel___

### Download Raspberry Pi OS image

You can find the image of the last Rspberry Pi OS in this [link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/). Follow the istructions and save the .img file in the main folder of this repository

## Run Raspberry Pi OS image on QEMU

First change the name of the image inside the start.sh script with the name of the image you downloaded (-hda argument):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

qemu-system-arm \
  -M versatilepb \
  -cpu arm1176 \
  -m 256 \
  -hda YOUR_IMAGE_NAME.img \
  -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::5022-:22 \
  -dtb qemu-rpi-kernel/versatile-pb-buster.dtb \
  -kernel qemu-rpi-kernel/kernel-qemu-4.19.50-buster \
  -append 'root=/dev/sda2 panic=1' \
  -no-reboot 
```

Now you can simply run the script and qemu will start:

```bash
./start.sh
```

The default username and password for the Raspberry Pi OS are:
 
 * User: pi
 * Password: raspberry

### Connect via ssh to the Raspberry Pi OS

In order to connect via ssh to the Raspberry Pi OS running on qemu, open a terminal in Raspberry Pi OS and start the ssh service:

```bash
sudo service ssh start
```

You can now connect to the Raspberry Pi OS from your host system:

```bash
ssh pi@127.0.0.1 -p 5022 -X
```

And send file to the Raspberry Pi OS using scp:

```bash
scp -P 5022 -r PATH_OF_THE_FOLDER_IN_THE_HOST_SYSTEM pi@127.0.0.1:PATH_OF_THE_DESTINATION_FOLDER_IN_RASPBERRY_PI_OS
```

If SSH doesnâ€™t start in your emulator at startup by default, you can change that inside your Pi terminal with:

```bash
sudo update-rc.d ssh enable
```

## Assembly code

Inside the ___assembly___ directory there are 2 programs written in assembly:

* prodottoMain.s: Simple program that calculates the product of 2 integers. The input numbers are read using the clib functions printf and scanf. The function that actually calculates the product is stored in a different source file (prodottoFunc.s)
* ledon.s: Simple program that uses some GPIO pins to control 3 leds pressing a button. This code will only run on a real raspberry hardware since the GPIO pins are not emulated in the kernel used here

### Assembling and running prodottoMain

In order to assemble prodottoMain in the raspberry Pi OS we can use gcc:

```bash
gcc -g -o prodotto prodottoFunc.s prodottoMain.s
```

After running gcc the executable is saved in the file prodotto. To run the program we can simply execute the following command:

```bash
./prodotto
```

If we want to run it in debug mode we can use gdb:

```bash
gdb ./prodotto
```

Please refer to this [tutorial](https://azeria-labs.com/debugging-with-gdb-introduction/) to learn how to use the basic function of gdb debugger

### Assembling and running ledon

In order to run this code you need a raspberry Pi 2/3 board. The program is expecting to have 3 leds connected to the pins GPIO 5, 6 and 26, and a button connected to the pin GPIO 22. The following schematic shows a possible way to connect the components to the board.

![Schematic needed for ledon.s code](diagrams/schema_esempio_lezione.png)

The led connected to GPIO26 will turn on everytime the button is pressed, the led on GPIO5 will switch its state whenever the button transits from not-pressed to pressed, and the led on GPIO6 will switch its state whenever the button transits from pressed to not-pressed.

In order to assemble ledon.s in the raspberry Pi OS use gcc:

```bash
gcc -g -o ledon ledon.s
```

To run the program execute the following command:

```bash
./ledon
```

If we want to run it in debug mode use this command:

```bash
gdb ./ledon
```
